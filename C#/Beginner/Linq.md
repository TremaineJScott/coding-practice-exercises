# LINQ Exercises

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful feature in C# that allows developers to query various data sources in a consistent manner. These exercises are designed to improve your understanding and skills in using LINQ with C#.

## Exercise Set 1: Basics of LINQ

1. **Create a Number List:**
   - Declare and initialize a `List<int>` with five numbers.
   - Use LINQ to output all numbers in the list.

2. **String Array to List:**
   - Declare an array of strings containing some duplicate entries.
   - Use LINQ to convert the array to a list and remove the duplicates.

3. **LINQ Over Character Array:**
   - Create an array of characters from a given string.
   - Use LINQ to find the distinct characters and print them.

## Exercise Set 2: Querying with LINQ

1. **Sum with LINQ:**
   - Given an integer array, use LINQ to find the sum of the elements.

2. **Sorting Array Elements:**
   - Use LINQ to sort an array of strings in descending order.

## Exercise Set 3: Advanced LINQ Operations

1. **Finding Maximum with LINQ:**
   - Create a method that takes a list of integers and uses LINQ to find and return the maximum value.

2. **Calculating Average:**
   - Write a method that takes an array of doubles and uses LINQ to calculate and return the average value.

3. **Filtering Based on Condition:**
   - Given an array of integers, use LINQ to find all the numbers that are divisible by a given integer and return them as a list.

4. **Aggregating Data:**
   - Create a list of decimal values representing prices. Use LINQ to calculate the total and average price.

5. **Grouping and Counting:**
   - Given a list of words, use LINQ to group them by their first letter and count the occurrences of each letter.

Remember to test each of these exercises with different data sets to ensure your LINQ queries are working as expected.
