# Basic Loops Exercises

Loops are essential in programming for executing repetitive tasks efficiently. This document contains exercises to practice using `for` loops, `while` loops, `do...while` loops, and nested loops in C#.

## For Loop Exercises

1. **Sum of Numbers**: Write a `for` loop that sums all numbers from 1 to 100 and prints out the result.
2. **Countdown**: Create a `for` loop that starts from 10 and counts down to 0, then prints "Liftoff!".
3. **Alphabet Printing**: Use a `for` loop to print each letter in the English alphabet from 'A' to 'Z'.

## While Loop Exercises

1. **Guess the Number**: Implement a `while` loop that continues to ask the user to guess a predetermined number until they guess correctly.
2. **Accumulate User Input**: Write a `while` loop that sums numbers entered by the user until the user enters a zero.
3. **Factorial Calculation**: Create a `while` loop that calculates the factorial of a given number `n`.

## Do While Loop Exercises

1. **Input Validation**: Use a `do...while` loop to continually ask the user for a positive integer until they provide one.
2. **Post-Counting**: Implement a `do...while` loop that increments a counter and prints each value, stopping when the counter reaches 5.
3. **Reverse String**: Write a `do...while` loop that reverses a string input by the user.

## Nested Loops Exercises

1. **Multiplication Table**: Use nested loops to print a multiplication table from 1 to 10. For each row, multiply the row number by each column number.
2. **Pattern Printing**: Create a program using nested loops that prints a pattern like a triangle or a square. For example, a simple triangle pattern using asterisks `*`.
