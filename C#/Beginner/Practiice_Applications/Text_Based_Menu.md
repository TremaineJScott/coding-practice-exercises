## Challenge: Text-Based Menu System Using a Dictionary

In this challenge, you will implement a simple text-based menu system using a dictionary in C#. The keys of the dictionary will represent menu options, and the values will be functions that execute the corresponding menu option.

### Objective
Create an interactive menu-driven application where each menu option triggers a specific function. This will help you understand how dictionaries can be used to map keys (menu options) to values (function calls).

### Implementation

1. **Define the Menu Options**: Create a dictionary where each key is a string representing a menu option, and the value is a delegate or a function that executes the corresponding action.

2. **Build the Menu System**: Write a method to display the menu options and capture the user's choice.

3. **Invoke Functions**: Based on the user's choice, invoke the corresponding function from the dictionary.

### Task
Implement additional options in the menu system and define corresponding functions. Each function should perform a distinct action, demonstrating the flexibility and utility of the dictionary in managing menu choices.

#### Note: 
This challenge helps you practice using dictionaries in a more dynamic context, integrating user input and function execution in a simple yet effective way.
