## Practical Exercises
To solidify your understanding of dictionaries, here are some hands-on exercises. These will help you practice creating, manipulating, and iterating through dictionaries.

### Exercise 1: 
Create a dictionary to represent a phone book. Add at least five name-number pairs, update a number, and remove an entry. Then, print out the entire phone book.

### Exercise 2: 
Write a program that takes words and their meanings as input from the user and stores them in a dictionary. Then, allow the user to input a word and display its meaning.

### Exercise 3: 
Create a dictionary to store product prices. Write a function that calculates the total price of a shopping list. Test this function with a list of products.

### Exercise 4: 
Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in a given string. Display the frequencies in descending order.

### Exercise 5: Challenge
Implement a simple text-based menu system using a dictionary. The keys are the menu options, and the values are functions that execute the selected option.
