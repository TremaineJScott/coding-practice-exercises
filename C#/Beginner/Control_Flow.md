# Control Flow Exercises

Control flow statements are fundamental in programming, allowing you to dictate how your program should make decisions and choose different paths of execution. Below are exercises that will help you practice using `if...else`, `if...else if...else`, ternary operators, and `switch` statements in C#.

## if...else Exercises

1. Write an `if...else` statement that prints "Good morning!" if the time is earlier than 12 PM, and "Good afternoon!" otherwise.
2. Use an `if...else` statement to check if a number is odd or even and print an appropriate message.
3. Create an `if...else` statement to determine if a user is a child (age < 13), a teenager (age 13-19), or an adult (age > 19) and print a message for each case.
4. Write an `if...else` statement that checks if a variable `temperature` is above 30 degrees. If it is, print "It's a hot day"; otherwise, print "It's a pleasant day".
5. Use `if...else` to determine if a character entered is a vowel or a consonant and output the result.

## if...else if...else Exercises

1. Write a control flow that prints "Failing" for grades below 60, "Passing" for grades between 60 and 70, "Good" for grades between 71 and 80, "Very Good" for grades between 81 and 90, and "Excellent" for grades above 90.
2. Create a program that categorizes the sizes of t-shirts into "S", "M", "L", "XL", and prints out the size description, such as "Small", "Medium", "Large", "Extra Large".
3. Write a control flow to determine what generation a person belongs to: "Gen Z", "Millennials", "Gen X", "Boomers", based on their birth year.
4. Use `if...else if...else` to write a program that determines a person's life stage: infant, toddler, child, teenager, adult, elder based on their age.
5. Create a control flow to print out the type of website (commercial, organization, network, educational) based on its domain suffix (com, org, net, edu).

## Ternary Operator Exercises

1. Use the ternary operator to assign a variable `isAdult` a value of `true` if age is 18 or greater, or `false` otherwise.
2. Write a ternary operation that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero and assigns a string with the result to a variable.
3. Utilize the ternary operator to decide if a variable `result` should be "Pass" or "Fail" based on a test score variable.
4. Use a ternary operator to determine whether the number of hours slept is enough, setting a `wellRested` variable to "Yes" or "No".
5. Implement a ternary operator to select between two greeting messages: one for daytime and one for nighttime.

## Switch Statement Exercises

1. Write a `switch` statement that takes an integer representing a month and prints out the name of the season it falls in.
2. Use a `switch` case to handle different arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) given two numbers and an operator.
3. Create a `switch` statement that provides a simple description of an HTTP status code (200, 404, 500).
4. Implement a `switch` case to categorize a character into uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, or special character.
5. Develop a `switch` statement that converts a numeral (1-7) into the corresponding day of the week and prints it out.
