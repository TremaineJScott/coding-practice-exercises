# Arrays Exercises

Arrays are fundamental in programming, providing a way to store and manipulate collections of data. This document contains exercises to practice declaring, initializing, and using arrays in C#.

## Exercise Set 1: Declaring and Initializing Arrays

1. **Create a Number Array**: Declare and initialize an array of integers with five numbers.
2. **Days of the Week**: Declare an array of strings, initialize it with the names of the seven days of the week.
3. **Character Array**: Create an array of characters containing at least five different characters.

## Exercise Set 2: Looping through Arrays with FOR Loop

1. **Sum of Array Elements**: Write a `for` loop to sum all the elements in an integer array.
2. **Print in Reverse**: Use a `for` loop to print all the elements of a string array in reverse order.

## Exercise Set 3: Passing Arrays into Methods

1. **Find Maximum**: Create a method that takes an array of integers and returns the largest number.
2. **Average Value**: Write a method that takes an array of doubles and returns the average value.
